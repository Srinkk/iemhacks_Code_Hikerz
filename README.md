## Problem Statement
At present, parents don’t get time to pay enough attention to the children, especially when it comes to their mental health. And even for the adults, feelings of being excluded, unattended by the loved ones, problems/stress at work etc. can start to develop serious illnesses in their subconscious minds. 
Most of the time people don’t even know that they are suffering from depression.
